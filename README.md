# Serenity by Fatima

Serenity by Fatima is a mobile application developed using Flutter, designed with personal security as its primary focus. The application aims to provide users, particularly women, with a tool to alert loved ones in case of danger or when assistance is needed urgently. This initiative arose from the concerning rates of crimes against women in Pakistan and the imperative need for enhanced safety measures.
